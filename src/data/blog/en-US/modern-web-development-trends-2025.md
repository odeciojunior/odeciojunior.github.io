As we progress through 2025, the web development landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace. This article explores the key trends that are shaping how we build web applications today.

## AI-Powered Development Tools

The integration of AI in development workflows has become more sophisticated:

### Code Generation and Assistance
- **GitHub Copilot** and similar tools have matured
- **AI-powered testing** generates comprehensive test suites
- **Automated refactoring** tools improve code quality

### Design-to-Code Translation
- Tools like **v0** by Vercel convert designs to React components
- **Figma plugins** generate production-ready code
- **Visual AI builders** democratize web development

## Framework Evolution

### React Server Components
React's server components have gained widespread adoption:

```jsx
// Server Component
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id);
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <PostContent content={post.content} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Next.js App Router
The App Router has become the standard for Next.js applications:
- **Nested layouts** for better component organization
- **Streaming** for improved performance
- **Server actions** for form handling

### SvelteKit Maturation
SvelteKit has established itself as a serious alternative:
- **Excellent developer experience**
- **Superior performance** metrics
- **Growing ecosystem** of plugins and tools

## TypeScript Dominance

TypeScript adoption has reached critical mass:
- **95% of new projects** use TypeScript
- **Better IDE support** with enhanced IntelliSense
- **Type-safe APIs** with tools like tRPC

## Edge Computing and Serverless

### Edge Functions
- **Vercel Edge Functions** for global performance
- **Cloudflare Workers** for distributed computing
- **AWS Lambda@Edge** for CDN customization

### Database at the Edge
- **PlanetScale** with branching workflows
- **Turso** for SQLite at the edge
- **Neon** with serverless Postgres

## Build Tools Revolution

### Vite's Continued Growth
Vite has become the build tool of choice:
- **Lightning-fast** development server
- **Plugin ecosystem** rivals webpack
- **Framework agnostic** approach

### Bun and Alternative Runtimes
- **Bun** as a Node.js alternative
- **Deno** gaining enterprise adoption
- **Better package management** solutions

## CSS Innovations

### Container Queries
Native container queries are now widely supported:

```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card-content {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

### CSS-in-JS Evolution
- **Zero-runtime** solutions gaining popularity
- **Vanilla Extract** for type-safe styling
- **Tailwind CSS** continues to dominate

## Web Performance Focus

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP, FID, CLS** optimization is standard practice
- **Performance budgets** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Real User Monitoring** (RUM) adoption

### Image Optimization
- **Next.js Image** component best practices
- **WebP and AVIF** format adoption
- **Lazy loading** strategies

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Hot Reload and Fast Refresh
- **Near-instantaneous** development feedback
- **State preservation** during updates
- **Better error boundaries**

### Testing Evolution
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Storybook** for component testing

## Security and Privacy

### Content Security Policy
Stricter CSP implementations:
- **Nonce-based** script loading
- **Trusted Types** API usage
- **Subresource Integrity** checks

### Privacy-First Analytics
